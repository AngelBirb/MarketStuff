WindstridesClothingPack - I was having problems with some items not appearing, for some odd reason Sweaters_And_Hoodies doesn't appear whatsoever (Even with just vanilla files) so everything was put into Coats_And_Jackets. On top of that, putting some items into Variations would cause the category to disappear - so they had to be separated, sorry about that.
