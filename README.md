WCP - These are going to have default values as stated by the Traders(Outdated) file in the Original mod, so 500. If you want to edit them before adding them go ahead!

WindstridesClothingPack - I was having problems with some items not appearing, for some odd reason Sweaters_And_Hoodies weren't appearing whatsoever(Even with just vanilla files) so everything was put into Coats_And_Jackets. On top of that putting some  of the items into Variations would cause the category to disappear so they had to be separated, sorry about that.
